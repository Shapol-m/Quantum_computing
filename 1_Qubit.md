Lesson 1: The Qubit


The equivalent to bit from classical computers in quantum computing is the qubit. On this page, I will cover what a qubit is, how we can represent the qubit in a mathematical sense and in q#. I'll also cover the Dirac notation, superposition and the Hadamard basis (don't worry about this jargon. I will explain all this. I will also try to minimise the use of jargon.)
